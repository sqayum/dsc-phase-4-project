# A. *Business Understanding*

*Gallup*, a global analytics and advice firm, plans to conduct a large-scale survey regarding public sentiment towards the political parties in the United States. In order to achieve this, they require a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content. Once training of the model has been completed, it is to be deployed as a sentiment analysis tool for that recieves data from the Twitter API.

# B. *Data Understanding*

> *The [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/home) dataset will be used to train the classification model. It is a collection of $1,600,000$ tweets, all of which are labelled with a corresponding value indicating sentiment.*

> __The dataset consists of 5 input features and 1 target variable:__
> * __id__ *[int] - unique identifier of the tweet*
> * __date__ *[str] - date the tweet was posted*
> * __user__ *[str] - user that posted the tweet*
> * __text__ *[str] - content of the tweet*
---
> * __target__ *[str] - label indicating sentiment expressed in the tweet*
>   - __0__ - *negative*
>   - __4__ - *positive*


It is crucial to note that the data in *Sentiment140* is weakly labeled, that is, its labels were generated automatically based on some heuristic. In the technical paper associated with *Sentiment140*, *[Twitter Sentiment Classification using Distant Supervision](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/papers/TwitterDistantSupervision09.pdf)*, this process is summarized:

> "*With the large range of topics discussed on Twitter, it would be very difficult to manually collect enough data to train a sentiment classifier for tweets. Our solution is to use distant supervision, in which our training data consists of tweets with emoticons. The emoticons serve as noisy labels. For example, :) in a tweet indicate that the tweet contains positive sentiment and :( indicates that the tweet contains negative sentiment.*"

The heuristic outlined above was chosen to generate labels because it had previsiously been shown that emoticons have the potential of being independent of domain, time, and topic [refer to *[Using Emoticons to Reduce Dependency in Machine Learning Techniques for Sentiment Classification](https://aclanthology.org/P05-2008.pdf)* for more details]. At the time when *Sentiment140* was being compiled, this property made emoticons the ideal candidate for such a heuristic. Utilizing such a simple heuristic rule for classifying something as complex as sentiment is bound to produce a substantial number of incorrect labels. Fortunately, there now exists a better alternative to rule-based label generation.

> *__For this analysis, the original labels will be discarded, and new set of labels will be generated by the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) model.__*

<br>

> *VADER is a sentiment analysis engine that utilizes a parsimonious lexicon in conjunction with a rule-based model. The following features justify its use as a replacement for rule-based label generation:*
> - *the model relies on a lexicon that is specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts (e.g. Twitter)*
> - *the model does not rely on statistical learning to make predictions and therefore does not require training data*
> - *the model is highly accurate -- experimental results show that it predicts the sentiment of tweets with an *F1 Classification Accuracy* of $0.96$ [refer to [VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf) for more details]*

In addition to obtaining more accurate labels, performing sentiment analysis with VADER will allow for the additional classification of tweets that express a neutral sentiment. Although tweets such as these were not considered during the construction of *Sentiment104*, the sheer number of tweets combined with the inaccuracy of the current labels makes it likely that a significant number of neutral tweets are present in the dataset. Thus, for the sake of producing a finer classification model, tweets classified as neutral by VADER will remain with that label throughout the remainder of this project.
